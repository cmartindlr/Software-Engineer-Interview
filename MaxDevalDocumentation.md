Instructions to Run:

TODO


Technical note:
I implemented a separate algorithm for each question for the sake of readability and reusability. For example, rather than loop over the individuals once to sum up their combined balance and simultaneously track most common eye colors as well, I implemented 2 separate loops: one which sums up the combined balance and another which tracks most the most common eye colors.

What would I have done with more time?
I would have developed a cross-platform front end using .NET MAUI (native) or ASP.NET Core and Blazor (web-based).
